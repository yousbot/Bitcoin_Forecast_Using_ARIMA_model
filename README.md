# Bitcoin Forecast Using ARIMA Model

![Archived](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Archived-red)

This repository focuses on Bitcoin value forecasting using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, in contrast to an Exponential Smoothing approach. The ARIMA model is commonly used in financial computing to analyze patterns in large datasets. 

The data for this project was sourced from [Bitcoin Charts](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#tgSzm1g10zm2g25zv), preserving only the date and prices in dollars. The Exponential Smoothing Algorithm was also applied to the data for comparison, and it yielded results that were entirely opposite to those obtained using the ARIMA model.

## Last Update

The last update using the ARIMA function from the Forecast Package was on 07/09/2017.
